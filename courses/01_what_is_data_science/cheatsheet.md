# Data Science Terminology Cheatsheet

**Feature**: An input variable used in predictive models.  
**Target (Label)**: The outcome variable a model is trained to predict.  
**ETL**: Extract, Transform, Load — the process of moving and converting data.  
**Big Data**: Datasets too large or complex for traditional databases.  

**CRISP-DM**: Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining

**CSV**: Comma-Separated Values — plain-text table format.  
**JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation — lightweight data-interchange format.  
**Parquet**: Columnar storage format for efficient data processing.

**Supervised Learning**: Models learn from labeled data (regression, classification).  
**Unsupervised Learning**: Models learn from unlabeled data (clustering, dimensionality reduction).  
**Model Evaluation**: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall for classification; RMSE, MAE for regression.
